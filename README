To run the CSE Demo program, you must:

1) Obtain and install these tools:
-- MongoDB 2.0.1
-- PHP 5.3
-- GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic (GMP) PHP extension 
-- MongoDB PHP extension

2) Enable the PHP extensions listed above by adding these lines to your web server's PHP.ini file:
-- extension=php_gmp.dll
-- extension=php_mongo.dll

3) Copy the cse_demo directory obtained from github.com to your web server’s document root directory.
NOTE: Your web server MUST be listening for messages on a publically accessable IP address (hereinafter refered to as your_pub_ip_addr); otherwise, the Fabric will NOT be able to send messages to your server.

4) Open the file path_to_doc_root/cse_demo/.htaccess
-- Make sure that the RewriteBase path matches your web server's file setup.
-- If things don’t work, an incorrect path here is often the reason.

5) Obtain an API key for the Google product search API from this URL:
-- http://code.google.com/apis/shopping/search/v1/getting_started.html

6) Add this API key to the file offer_pub_capability_tx.php where indicated by the comment "<-- YOUR GOOGLE PRODUCT SEARCH API KEY HERE"

7) Use the the X.commerce Developer Portal to configure the sandbox Fabric to work with the CSE demo.
-- a) Browse to this URL -- https://devportal.x.com/ -- and sign in to the Developer Portal.
-- b) Click the Manage Sandbox button (in the lower-right of the page).
-- c) For the Offer Publisher capability, use the available screens to do these things:
----- i)   Register a capability named Offer Pub whose endpoint is http://your_pub_ip_addr/doc_root/cse_demo
----- ii)  Subscribe the Offer Pub capability to topic /cse/offer/created
----- iii) Create a test merchant named merchant 1 and subscribe this merchant to the Offer Pub capability.
----- iv)  Insert the tenant bearer token generated in the step above in the file offer_pub_capability_tx.php where indicated 
by the comment // INSERT YOUR TENANT BEARER TOKEN BELOW
-- d) For the CSE Capability, use the available screens to do these things:
----- i)   Register a capability named CSE whose endpoint is http://your_pub_ip_addr/doc_root/cse_demo
----- ii)  Subscribe the Offer Pub capability to topic /cse/offer/create
----- iii) Subscribe merchant 1 to the CSE capability.
----- iv)  Insert the tenant bearer token generated in the step above in the file cse_capability.php where indicated 
by the comment // INSERT YOUR TENANT BEARER TOKEN BELOW
-- e) Sign out of the Developer Portal.
 
8) From the command line, run this command: 
-- tail -f full_path_to_doc_root/cse_demo/cse.log 

-- The CSE capability writes to this log when it receives a message on topic /cse/offer/create and when it sends a message on topic/cse/offer/created. 
-- The tail command lets you see these writes as they happen, thereby showing that the CSE capability is working.

9) From the command line, run this command:
-- tail -f full_path_to_doc_root/cse_demo/offer_pub.log
 
-- The Offer Publisher capability writes to this log when it receives a message on /cse/offer/created.
-- The tail command lets you see these writes as they happen, thereby showing you that the Offer Publisher capability is working.

10) Start your web server.

11) From the command line, run this command:
-- php -f full_path_to_doc_root/cse_demo/offer_pub_capability_tx.php

-- If everything is set up correctly, you should see entries written to cse.log and then to offer_pub.log.
